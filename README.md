# Descartes Underwriting - Technical test

This project contains a base template using ReactJS that can be used for Descartes Underwriting technical test.

To install and run this template, use
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

# Instructions

## Submission

The solution to this test (source and test codes) should be saved on a private `descartes-app` repository on your github account.

Access should be granted to:

* <https://github.com/alexandreCameron>
* <https://github.com/f-combes>
* <https://github.com/achilleas-michos>
* <https://github.com/michelclet>

## Duration

Preparing the test should take 3 to 5 hours.

## Task

On a linux or docker environment, using a JS framework (React recommended) and a simple architecture create a form app.

This form app should be able to:

1. gather fields (eg: first name, last name, job, address, question)
2. save them (with a button)
3. produce a report of the information (on a separate page) 
4. allow audit of all past forms

The project should contain:

1. `README.md` with the commands to install and run the app locally 	
2. A diagram of the architecture (component and interaction)
3. A minimal CI/CD to check the code quality before integration on main branch

## Comment

Anything that is not listed in the task section does not have to be developed.
No need to bother with access management, signing etc.
